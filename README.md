Hospital Management System | C++, STL, Priority Queues, Algorithm Design

Engineered a hospital triage workflow using max-heaps for emergency severity ranking and FIFO queues for outpatient management, ensuring optimal patient servicing order.

Implemented core operations including patient registration, priority-based treatment selection, multi-level waiting lists, and structured hospital workflow logic.

Utilized STL containers (priority_queue, queue, vector) to achieve efficient O(log n) insertion and O(1) OPD scheduling with clear separation of emergency and non-emergency paths.

Designed extensible architecture supporting additional modules like doctor assignment, discharge summaries, and future data persistence for hospital analytics.
